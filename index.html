        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>We were first introduced to Angular in SE 396 (assignment six). In this class we used Angular to create a corporation finder. This included a search
        feature and the ability to drill down into the corportation details. While it was nice to start working with a new language, this
        assignment only provided us with a taste of what Angular could do. For this class I would like to study Angular in more depth. My goal will be
        to create a website for an anual memorial run. I plan to use the MEAN stack to create this application.</p>

              This week I spent several (4+) hours developing this website so I had a spot to keep me organized and display my work. Next
              I found a few relevant courses on Udemy to start my Angular research.  I began watching the MEAN stack video (3.5 hours).
              See the Resources section for a link to the content (it does require membership). I also started the framework for my
              Angular site (3+ hours) so I have something to work with. Next week I plan to continue my Angular class and see if I have
              enough information to make progress on my project.

            <div class="accordian-body">
              This week I continued my Udemy class on the MEAN stack. I reviewed how to install packages like Mocha and Express with NPM.
               I also learned the basics of Node.js and Express.  I worked on a demo project to explore how Express works which covered
               things like routing by default to the home page and how to update status codes. I have a basic app working that is minimally
                styled with a “sticky” footer and am able to make an API call which returns simple JSON. Watching the videos and working on
                demos from the videos took up most of my time this week at around 6 hours. I then worked on my own app for around 3 hours
                trying to repeat what I learned so I will be able to use it for my project. I struggled a bit this week to understanding how
                Node does asynchronous yes non-blocking calls. The concept seems contradictive but I will continue to review it this week. I
                also took longer to do the demos than I thought I would. It is different than things I have done in the past so I found myself
                re-watching large sections of the videos. Next week I plan to continue my research, practice the concepts and hope to get through
                section one of the Udemy class.

            <div class="accordian-body">
              This week was more of the Udemy class. I worked with Express and routes to create an API for getting all hotels and get
              one individual hotel (from the demo) with URL parameters from a static JSON file for testing. I am learning how to
              structure the application so it is neat, files are easy to find and file paths are easy to follow. This included adding
              pagination so the results of get all hotels (if you had all the hotels in the world) would be returned in a manageable way
              through the query string parameters. I also tested a POST for adding a new hotel with the help of the middleware body-parser
              I installed through NPM and the Chrome plugin Postman. Finally, I installed Nodemon globally so the server monitors changes
              and restarts when changes are made. Following these demos (and troubleshooting my errors) took around 6 hours. I spent 2-3 hours
              testing additional routes, adding folders for Nodemon ignores and making sure I followed the routing correctly.

              This week I continued the Udemy course. I learned about NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB which is a document
              store. Having only dealt with relational databases in school, this is a tough concept to grasp (1 hour). In order
              to work with MongoDB I needed to first install it on my Mac. I ran into a few issues since this Udemy class assumes
              you already have MongoDB installed and simply sends you to mongodb.org for a download if you have not. I ended up
              finding a YouTube tutorial (listed in my resources) to help me install MongoDB with Homebrew. This was easier to
              follow and helped me identify my previous issue which was the ownership of, who could use, MongoDB (2 hours). Once
              I was able to get the MongoDB installed and running I learned how to create a new database, new collection and then
              documents, followed by the basic CRUD operations for documents and collections. We then covered how to export the
              database as BSON or JSON and how to zip the data. We also covered how to create new databases and collections from
              a JSON file (3 hours). Finally, I updated the existing project to use a database with MongoDB instead of the original
              JSON file. I am now able to get all hotels, one hotel and add a hotel to the database (2 hours). Next week I will start
              building out the REST API and dive into Mongoose.

            <div class="accordian-body">
              This week's Udemy classes covered how to use Mongoose and how to define a Mongoose schema. This included schema
              types, basic validation, setting default values and being able to do this all in one place with JavaScript (2 hours).
              I then learned how to define and include subdocuments or schemas into the main schema, store geo-location coordinates and
              create a spherical index for geo-spatial data with 2D indexes for searching (3 hours). I used Mongoose queries for GET routes
              of the API to get multiple hotels, a subset of hotels and a single hotel. Then drilled further down to get multiple and then
              individual sub-documents (2 hours). I then used Mongoose to find hotels within a certain distance of other hotels. More
              excitingly, I learned how to add to the parent and sub-documents to add new reviews to existing hotels. I finished the week
              by completing the API with the remaining CRUD methods, update and delete (3 hours). Next week I will start learning about
              single page applications using AngularJs that will use the API I have just completed building.

            <div class="accordian-body">
              This week’s Udemy class began with an introduction to AngularJS with built in directives (1 hour). We then looked
              at built in filters (1 hour). Filters provide a way to format the data before displaying it. Next was Controllers,
              $scope and controllerAs (2 hours). It was recommended to use controllerAs over scope as it makes the code easier to
              use and also allows you to reference variables within different controllers. From here, I moved on to modules, single
              page apps, routes and templates (4 hours). Then build-in services and best practices for application architecture, custom
              services and Service vs factory (2 hour). More excitingly, I was finally able to connect the Angular app with the API! I am
              able to pull back a list of hotels as well as drill down to details about one of those hotels, as well as add a review to a
              specific hotel (3 hours). At this point in the video the instructor changed. This new one is not as clear in his direction.
              There is a lot of information and I am struggling a little to put it all together with what I learned about Node, Mongo and
              Mongoose. I am hoping I am not going to run out of time to build my application. Next week I will start working what I have
              learned into my own application.

              This week I ventured away from the Udemy class to make progress on my final project. I organized a list of
              information I will be using to showcase my AngularJS knowledge with on my site. (1 hour) I also added pages
              and navigation to my origin site I started at the beginning of the quarter (4 hours). This included some research
              on popular layouts for easy navigation and ease of use for the site (1 hour). I finished the week out trying to
              style my pages and come up with components I can reuse (3 hours). I did not run into any real issues this week.
              Next week I am looking forward to making significant progress on the data (AngualrJS) aspects of my site.

            <div class="accordian-body">
              This week I worked completely, all 16-20 hours, on my project. In this time, I have accomplished a great deal.
              I have my entire architecture built. Each page layout is built with all content. I have created a new mongo database
              which I can get information from and send information to. I have started to build out my Angular components and my
              mongoose schemas for the data I will send to the database. I struggled a lot this week. Taking what I learned in the
              video and translating it to a new application was difficult. Having this been only the second thing I have built, it
              took me a lot longer to figure out how to structure the application and make sure I had all the pieces in the right
              spot. Although I set out to learn Angular, I have actually learned much more than just Angular. While this was great
              for my learning, it also means that I have not built out as much in Angular alone as I originally thought I could
              accomplish. Next week I plan to finish my schemes, finish the structure of my forms and adding the data to the
              database. Finally, I will add a spot to pull the information from the database for purposes of proving the data is in
              the database in the correct structure.

              This week I worked on the schemas for my contact and registration form (3 hours). I then worked on adding validation
              and then submitting the sponsor and registration forms to a new collection in the database (4 hours). I also added an
              admin page and two new collections so I can show what is in the database. The forms submit correctly but without that
              page there is no “proof” the data went anywhere (1.5 hours). Finally, I spent time trying to research why my routing only
              works when coming from the main page. If a page other than home is refreshed it loses the route (2 hours). I have not yet
              been able to figure this out. Next week I plan to add the finishing touches to the site, hopefully figure out my routing
              issue and create my video for submission.
